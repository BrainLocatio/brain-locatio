# üìå Project Overview

This project provides technical articles retrieved through semantic search using LLaMA, with content generation powered by the OpenAI API.
Project also integrated 3rd party WeatherAPI.

## System-level Architecture

Frontend: Node.js, React, HTML, Tailwind CSS

Backend-for-Frontend (BFF)
- Separation of concerns
  - The semantic search service should focus on search logic, not auth, rate limiting, request shaping, etc.
  - Request shaping means modifying or enhancing incoming requests before they reach the actual business logic (like search, inference, or other core functionality).
  - The backend layer can handle authentication, validation, caching, request formatting (shaping), and aggregation. 
  - Aggregation means combining data from multiple sources or services into a single, unified response. E.g. semantic + weather
  Enforce authorization, manage API keys, and hide service internals.

Semantic search service
- perform calls to OpenAI if needed, and do the semantic search in text

## Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) Service

- Code-level Architecture: Layered architecture
- Handler pattern

API design

|-------------------------|----------|
| **API**                 | REST     |
| **Framework**           | FastAPI  |
| **Data validation**     | Pydantic |

## Semantic search microservice

|-------------------------|----------|
| **API**                 | gRPC     |
| **Framework**           | FastAPI  |

|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Deployment / Runtime:**    | Docker, Kubernetes  |
| **Infrastructure** | Terraform           |

- Frontend (if also in-cluster): can talk to BFF using internal DNS, e.g. http://bff-svc.default.svc.cluster.local.
- Backend (BFF): use a ClusterIP service (default) meaning it‚Äôs internal only.
