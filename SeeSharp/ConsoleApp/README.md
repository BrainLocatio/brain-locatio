## Code-level Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture.

### App controller
- **Program.cs** — Serves as the entry point of the application. It handles application startup and coordinates 
interactions between the user interface and the underlying services.

### 🎨 Presentation Layer 

Responsible for handling user interaction.
- **UI/ConsoleUI.cs** — Contains the console-based user interface logic for displaying data and receiving user input.

### 🧠 Business Logic Layer

Encapsulates the core functionality of the application.
- **Services/SentenceService.cs** — Handles business operations such as fetching and parsing raw data.

### 💾 Data Access Layer

Handles interaction with data storage.

- **Repositories/SentenceRepository.cs** — Manages storage and retrieval of Sentence entries.
